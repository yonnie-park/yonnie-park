I am an aspiring software engineer who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in computer science and art history.

My passion lies in solving problems with tailored algorithms and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders.

In my undergraduate studies at Columbia University, Iâ€™ve taken on various leadership roles including being President of KISAC (Korean International Society for Academics and Career), mentoring Korean undergraduate underclassmen via coffee chats, and coordinating institute-wide career events for international students.

I graduated in May 2022 and I'm interested in full-time software engineering roles. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email at juon0805@gmail.com .
