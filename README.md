<H2> Hi There 👋🏻 </H2>
I am an aspiring software engineer who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in computer science and art history.

My passion lies in solving problems with tailored algorithms and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders.

In my undergraduate studies at Columbia University, I’ve taken on various leadership roles including being President of KISAC (Korean International Society for Academics and Career), mentoring Korean undergraduate underclassmen via coffee chats, and coordinating institute-wide career events for international students.

I graduated in May 2022 and I'm interested in full-time software engineering roles. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email at juon0805@gmail.com .
